This folder includes Psychopy's test program for the EyeLink eyetracking system. This is titled picture.py. 

Picturev2.py is the updated eyetracking program for our CoLab experiment. The copy of picturev2.py was for testing. You can ignore it. 

the images folder is for the picture.py test program. The PSY stimuli folder contains the images used in picturev2.py. Those are placeholder images 
and can be changed out (just make sure in the code to change the lines for which images the program should use). 

The Results folder is where all the EyeLink Data Files (EDFs) are stored after completing the experiment.
